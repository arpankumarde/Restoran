          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Since bursting on to the scene in 2011, Hawksworth Restaurant has
            earned its place amongst the finest restaurants in the world,
            winning multiple accolades from renowned local and international
            authorities. Recognized for its compelling and technically skilled
            cuisine, deep and diverse wine list, inventive cocktail program, and
            warm, genuine hospitality. Located in the Rosewood Hotel Georgia,
            the dining room is a Vancouver landmark that is steeped in history,
            reimagined by Studio Munge to deliver three distinct rooms including
            the cocktail bar and lounge, the elegant pearl room, and the art
            room.
